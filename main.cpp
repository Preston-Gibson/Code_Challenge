//To-do: If I had more time I would have fixed a small bug with that happens after playing the game about 7 times through
//which ends the program without an error code. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with trying to use the 10th word "Mountain".
//After fixing the bug I would have created an if loop with another variable that would track how many times the game has been completed.
//After all the words had been guessed I would have created a different ending with a congratulatory message and ended the code without
//asking for the Y/N as it would be unnecessary to have that prompt.
